<h1> Databases </h1>

## Narrative

My original plan was to create a database either using my family or possibly a jail inmate database. I would use fake names and information. I then found access to a database using premade information that I could mold. Using SQL, I created the Database using the instructions listed below. This will create two tables filled with information for a small business. One will hold Agent information as the other will hold customer information.

## Enhancement

Enhancements have been made to a pre-existing database set. The database is for an insurance company. It is storing information on their agents, customers, and now order information. This is a great example of a real-life database that would be used in the everyday working environment. Anything that represents the everyday inner workings of small businesses is a great way to see how powerful these programs can be.

I believe I have met the objectives given. I wanted to enhance the project by showcasing my ability to manipulate the database information as well as expand on the already set base of information. A column from the Agents table was removed and a new table was created for orders to expand the use of the database. This has been the most interesting artifact so far for me. As I look back on the course where I was introduced to SQL, I wasnâ€™t a fan of it at the time. I felt overwhelmed at first but I hung in there and was able to finish the course with a better understanding. Revisiting SQL with this database. I have found that I really enjoyed manipulating the tables and felt comfortable early on. Like anything you haven't mastered, I ran into a speed bump here and there due to syntax and simple wording. Just had remind myself of the proper wording to manipulate the database and things started to move forward. As I get more practice with it, I am becoming more confidant.


The enhancements below shows us altering the Agents table by removing a column and creating a new table called orders. 


```
/* To delete the section of "country (enhancement) */
ALTER TABLE Agents DROP(country);

/* To veiw Agents table to see "country" now gone(enhancement)*/
SELECT * FROM Agents

/*Create a new table for "orders" (enhancement)*/
CREATE TABLE  "ORDERS" 
   (
        "ORD_NUM" NUMBER(6,0) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
	"ORD_AMOUNT" NUMBER(12,2) NOT NULL, 
	"ADVANCE_AMOUNT" NUMBER(12,2) NOT NULL, 
	"ORD_DATE" DATE NOT NULL, 
	"CUST_CODE" VARCHAR2(6) NOT NULL REFERENCES CUSTOMER, 
	"AGENT_CODE" CHAR(6) NOT NULL REFERENCES AGENTS, 
	"ORD_DESCRIPTION" VARCHAR2(60) NOT NULL
   );

/* insert vaules for Orders table (enhancement)*/
