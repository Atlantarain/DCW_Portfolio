<h1> Software Engineering and Design </h1>

## Narrative

The artifact is years old. It was originally designed as a basic introduction to creating 3D objects. It was a Program that creates a cube and a pyramid. With the enhancements, the 3b objects are better seen and represented in the 3d space. 
I chose this code because I felt it represents the foundation of a major project. 3D objects are the foundation of 3D animation and allow software for games and animation films. This basic code shows a peek of the overall design in creating stunning 3D visuals. I am proud of this coding because it shows my understanding of the space the 3D objects exist in. As detailed in my code review, both objects needed to be moved away from each other to avoid clipping. Then with the enhancement of becoming animated, that spacing became even more important as both objects donâ€™t collide while moving. With this addition of animation, the visual of both 3D objects are showcased as each side can now be seen.
