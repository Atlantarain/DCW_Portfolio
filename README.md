## Self Assessment

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Atlantarain/DCW_Portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
