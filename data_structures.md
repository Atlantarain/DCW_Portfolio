 ## Narrative
 
 This artifact is a simple Java grading program. It is a easy to use grading system teachers can use to enter a student's grades and get the average and letter grade. This code was chosen was because I felt it was structured to be simple but yet very powerful program. Using the mathmatic coding to reach the desired results shows how structure is important to excuting the code.
